# Introduction #
Like most of the other open source frameworks, this originated from a very personal and specific requirement. [ResponseHeaderFilter](http://code.google.com/p/responseheaderfilter/) is much more extensive and extensible than what it originally was. This has happened only because of users like yourself, who have kept me enthused by sending feature requests.

The easiest way to get involved is help me fix the [open issues](http://code.google.com/p/responseheaderfilter/issues/list). Create issues only when they have not been reported earlier. I would appreciate initiatives for helping me out to create better and elaborate documentation for this filter.
